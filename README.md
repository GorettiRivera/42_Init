# 42_Init
## System and Network Administration

This first project, init, will give you the opportunity to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of
scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

There are three types of questions in this project. You can identify the type of answer
expected thanks to a color code:
* In blue : a command
* In green : a command output
* In red : a deduction, written in your own words

The part 1 “Network” must be done on school’s Macs. 
The part 2 and 3, “System” and “Scripting” must be done on a Debian virtual machine.
